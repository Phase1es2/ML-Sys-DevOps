## Unit 8: Data Management

### Persistent Storage

To enable persistent storage access during training and inference, we completed the following steps:

1. **Provisioned Storage:**
   - Created one **40 GB block storage volume** and mounted it at `/mnt/block/` on `node1-cloud-project45`.
   - Created one **object storage bucket** (used for storing datasets like Urban100 and BSD100).

2. **Installed and Configured `rclone`:**
   - Installed `rclone` on the persistent compute node (`node-persist`).
   - Configured FUSE to allow user-mounted volumes to be accessed by other users and Docker containers.
   - Created a `rclone.conf` configuration file using the application credential ID, secret, and user ID.

3. **Mounted Object Storage:**
   - Created a mount point at `/mnt/object` and granted ownership to the `cc` user.
   - Used `rclone mount` to mount the object storage bucket (read-only) to `/mnt/object` with the `--allow-other` flag, enabling access from Docker containers and other services.

4. **Shell Script:**
   - Provided an automated setup script `setup_rclone_mnt.sh` under the `script/` directory to simplify the mounting process on new instances. This ensures consistent and reliable data access across the team.
  - **/mnt/object and /mnt/block:**

### Offline Datasets & Lineage

- **Training dataset:** DIV2K  
- **Validation & Evaluation datasets:** BSD100, Urban100  
- **Example sample(s):**  
  ![Sample](img/0004.png)

The DIV2K dataset contains **1,000 high-resolution (2K) images**, split into:

- **Training Set:** 800 images  
- **Validation Set:** 100 images  
- **Test Set:** 100 images  

#### Data Lineage

1. **Raw Data Source:**
   - Downloaded from the official NTIRE 2017 Super-Resolution Challenge repository.
   - Files: `0001.png` to `1000.png`, each at 2K resolution.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Low-resolution (LR) images are generated using bicubic downsampling at 3 scales:
     - `YYYYx2.png` → ×2 scale
     - `YYYYx3.png` → ×3 scale
     - `YYYYx4.png` → ×4 scale
   - LR images are aligned with their high-resolution (HR) counterparts.
   - No additional image preprocessing is applied offline; cropping is done during training to maintain 1:1 aspect ratio.

---

### Offline Data Pipeline

We implemented a complete ETL pipeline using Docker Compose (`docker/docker-compose-etl.yaml`) to automate the download, organization, and upload of super-resolution datasets.

#### Data Extraction

Datasets are downloaded from Kaggle using three dedicated containers:

- `extract-data`: Downloads **DIV2K** (`div2k.zip`)
- `extract-test-data`: Downloads **Urban100** (`urban100.zip`)
- `extract-bsd100`: Downloads **BSD100** (`bsd100.zip`)

Each dataset is extracted into a shared volume (`sr:/data`) for downstream processing.

#### Data Transformation

Organized into structured folders:

- **DIV2K:**
  - `div2k/train`: 800 HR images (training)
  - `div2k/validation`: 100 HR images (validation)

- **Urban100:**
  - `test/urban100_x2/lr` and `hr`: ×2 scale testing
  - `test/urban100_x4/lr` and `hr`: ×4 scale testing

- **BSD100:**
  - `eval/bsd100_x2/lr` and `hr`: ×2 scale evaluation
  - `eval/bsd100_x4/lr` and `hr`: ×4 scale evaluation

#### Data Upload

The `load-data` container (based on the official `rclone` image) uploads the final dataset folder structure to the object store:

- **Destination:** `chi_tacc:$RCLONE_CONTAINER`
- Uses `rclone copy` with multi-threaded streaming (`--transfers`, `--checkers`, `--multi-thread-streams`)
- Cleans up prior files using `rclone delete` to avoid stale content
- Uploaded structure becomes accessible at `/mnt/object` during training/inference

---

### Data Splits & Leakage Avoidance

- **Training Set:** 800 HR–LR image pairs (DIV2K)
- **Validation Set:** 100 HR–LR image pairs (DIV2K)
- **Evaluation Sets:**
  - Urban100 (×2 and ×4 scales)
  - BSD100 (×2 and ×4 scales)

All datasets are separated strictly by source and use-case (train/validation/evaluation), and no images are shared between them. This ensures there is **no data leakage**, and evaluation remains unbiased.


### Block Storage Volumes for Persistent Services

To ensure data and service state are persistent across instance restarts, we mount our block storage volume (e.g., `/mnt/block`) into several key services in the Docker Compose environment:

| Service     | Mounted Volume                     | Purpose                                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| MinIO       | `/mnt/block/minio_data:/data`      | Stores MLflow artifact files (via S3 API)   |
| PostgreSQL  | `/mnt/block/postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` | Stores MLflow tracking metadata             |
| Prometheus  | `/mnt/block/prometheus:/prometheus`| Stores monitoring time-series data          |
| Grafana     | `/mnt/block/grafana:/var/lib/grafana` | Stores dashboards and user configuration  |

All these directories reside under a single mounted block volume, making them:

- **Persistent** across node restarts
- **Portable** across compute instances (if remounted)
- **Centralized** for easy backup or replication

This volume is manually mounted on the host system (e.g., `/dev/vdc1` → `/mnt/block`) before Docker Compose is run.

## 🤖 Unit 4 & 5: Model Training

### 🧮 Modeling Setup
- Inputs: **Low-resolution images** (e.g., /mnt/object/div2k/train/) generated via bicubic downsampling from **DIV2K** and **Urban100** datasets.
- Outputs: **High-resolution reconstructed images**, evaluated by PSNR, SSIM, and visual similarity.
![LR vs HR](img/data.png)
- Model Used: **DepthPro** — a deep super-resolution model designed for recovering fine image details.
- Why this model fits your user & task:

  We selected **DepthPro** for its strong ability to preserve structural and edge details—critical for high-quality image restoration.  
  For example, when applied to datasets like Urban100, which contain fine textures and geometric patterns (e.g., building facades, railings, signage), DepthPro consistently outperformed simpler CNN-based models such as SRCNN and UNet.  
  It delivered sharper outputs with fewer artifacts and significantly higher PSNR/SSIM scores, especially at ×4 upscaling.



  The model’s **PyTorch Lightning** implementation also fit our engineering goals. It enabled:

  - ✅ Fast integration with **mixed precision training**, cutting epoch runtime by ~30%.
  - ✅ Seamless experiment tracking via **MLflow autologging**, without modifying model internals.
  - ✅ Easy reuse in both training and manual retraining workflows, including **Ray-based jobs**.



  These characteristics made DepthPro an ideal fit for our use case: scalable, reproducible, and high-performance super-resolution, tailored for users who need to restore low-quality images into usable high-resolution outputs for publishing, archival, or product display.

## 🔁 Unit 8: Online Data

### 📡 Online Data Flow

In production, new data is sent to the inference endpoint using a Python script located in the `script/` directory: `send_to_inference_endpoint.py`.

- **Input:** The script reads low-resolution images from the directory `/mnt/object/bsd100`.
- **Process:** Each image is sent via a POST request to the FastAPI inference server running at `http://<host>:5000`.
- **Output:** The server returns the super-resolved image, which the script then saves to a local directory.

This setup enables automated, batch-style inference suitable for production pipelines.
